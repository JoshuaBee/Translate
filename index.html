				<h2>What?</h2>

				<p>I had the idea to try and see which non-English letters looked most like each of the letters in the English alphabet. This is excluding letters like Ã‰, because well, obviously, that looks like an English letter!</p>
				<br />
				<p>This then expanded to use other Unicode characters that seemed interesting, like Mathematical Operators and Dingbats as well.</p>

				<h2>How?</h2>

				<p>I thought the easiest way to achieve this was to have a neural network be able to predict which English letter an image of a letter was. Then once I had the model, I could get it to predict characters that the model had not seen, and the model would estimate which English letter it looked most like.</p>
				<br />

				<h3>Getting the dataset</h3>

				<p>The first thing I needed was the image dataset. I created 28x28 pixel black-and-white images of the English characters, including separating the uppercase and lowercase characters. I used some simple techniques to increase the variability in the dataset, including using different fonts, varying font sizes and applying rotations. This generated a dataset of 90,272 images.</p>
				<br />

					width="478"
					alt="Examples of character images from the generated dataset"
				/>

				<h3>Getting the model</h3>

				<p>First, I tried to get a model which would take a character and try and predict which of the 52 English letters (26 uppercase and 26 lowercase) was closest. This did not work, as there was no way for a letter to not look like an English letter. What this meant in reality was lots of false positives, because the model had to say it looked like something!</p>
				<br />
				<p>My next attempt was to generate 52 different models, one for each English letter. Each model would only have 1 question to answer, does the symbol look like my specific English letter or not? This worked much better, though having 52 models was a bit cumbersome.</p>

				<h3>Getting the results</h3>

				<p>Now that I have the model, it was time to test the models against symbols they had not seen before. I got a list of Unicode characters and looped over them, creating a 28x28 pixel black-and-white image of the character and running it through the 52 models. This took a while to run, but generated a list of results that had a very good rate of true positives, but also a bad rate of false positives. What this means is, if a unicode character did look like an English letter, my code was pretty good at finding it. It also had a habit of adding gibberish as well.</p>
				<br />
				<p>All this meant was that I had to do a little manual pruning of the data to make it seem less insane.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Looking at the results, I think I would class it as a success. It does seem like the worst font created in history though.</p>

				<h2>Why?</h2>

				<p>I like trying to solve problems that I come up with!</p>
